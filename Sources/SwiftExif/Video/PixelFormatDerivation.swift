/// bit depth, chroma subsampling and color range. The goal is to match the
/// strings `ffprobe -show_streams` emits closely enough that downstream
/// consumers (e.g. Aagedal Media Converter) can treat them as a drop-in
/// replacement for the ffprobe field.
///
/// Coverage is intentionally limited to the common YUV/RGB planar formats
/// that ship in the codecs SwiftExif recognises. Rare endian/interleave
/// variants (NV12, packed YUYV, p010le …) aren't synthesised here — the
/// container doesn't usually tell us the difference anyway.
